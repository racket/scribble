language provides all of @racketmodname[scribble/base] plus many
additional functions that are specific to writing Racket

information.

The @racketmodname[scribble/manual] name can also be used as a library

@section[#:tag "scribble:manual:code"]{Typesetting Code}

The @racket[codeblock] and @racket[code] forms (see
@secref["all-code"]) typeset code verbatim, adding a layer of color to
the code based on the same syntax-coloring parsers that are used by
DrRacket. Input that is parsed as an identifier is further given a
lexical context and hyperlinked via @racket[for-label] imports.

The @racket[racketblock] and @racket[racket] forms (see
@secref["racket-code"]) typeset S-expression code roughly verbatim,
but roughly by quoting the source term with
@racket[syntax]. Identifiers in the quoted S-expression are
hyperlinked via @racket[for-label] imports.

The two different approaches to typesetting code---@racket[codeblock]
and @racket[code] versus @racket[racketblock] and
@racket[racket]---have different advantages and disadvantages:

@itemlist[

 @item{The @racket[codeblock] and @racket[code] forms work with
       non-S-expression syntax, and they give authors more control
       over output (e.g., the literal number @code{2/4} is not
       normalized to @racket[2/4]). The @racket[codeblock] and
       @racket[code] forms do not yet support escapes to Scribble
       element mode, and they cannot adapt spacing based on the width
       of elements in escapes.}

 @item{The @racket[racketblock] and @racket[racket] forms are more
       efficient and allow escapes to Scribble element mode. The
       @racket[racketblock] and @racket[racket] forms are tied to
       S-expression syntax, however, and they are based on a syntax
       representation that tends to normalize source terms (e.g., the
       literal number @code{2/4} is normalized to @racket[2/4]).}

Parses the code formed by the strings produced by the
@racket[str-expr]s as a Racket module (roughly) and produces a
@tech{block} that typesets the code inset via @racket[nested] with the
style @racket['code-inset]. See also @racket[typeset-code].

The @racket[str-expr]s should normally start with @hash-lang[] to
determine the reader syntax for the module, but the resulting
``module'' need not expand or compile---except as needed by
@racket[expand-expr]. If @racket[expand-expr] is omitted or produces
false, then the input formed by @racket[str-expr] is read until an
end-of-file is encountered, otherwise a single form is read from the
input.

When @racket[keep-expr] produces a true value (the default), the first
line in the input (which is typically @hash-lang[]) is preserved in
the typeset output, otherwise the first line is dropped. The typeset
code is indented by the amount specified by @racket[indent-expr],
which defaults to @racket[0].

When @racket[expand-expr] produces @racket[#f] (which is the default),
identifiers in the typeset code are colored and linked based on
for-label bindings in the lexical environment of the syntax object
provided by @racket[context-expr]. The default @racket[context-expr]
has the same lexical context as the first @racket[str-expr].
When @racket[line-number-expr] is true, line number is enabled starting 
from @racket[line-number-expr], and @racket[line-number-sep-expr] controls
the separation (in spaces; defaults to 1) between the line numbers and
code.

When @racket[expand-expr] produces a procedure, it is used to
macro-expand the parsed program, and syntax coloring is based on the
parsed program.

For example,

@codeblock[#:keep-lang-line? #f]|<|{
  #lang scribble/manual
  @codeblock|{
    #lang scribble/manual
    @codeblock{
      #lang scribble/manual
      @title{Hello}
    }
  }|
}|>|

produces the typeset result

  @codeblock|{
    #lang scribble/manual
    @codeblock{
      #lang scribble/manual
      @title{Hello}
    }
  }|

@subsection[#:tag "racket-code"]{Racket Code}

@defform/subs[(racketblock maybe-escape datum ...)
              ([maybe-escape code:blank
                            (code:line #:escape escape-id)])]{

Typesets the @racket[datum] sequence as a table of Racket code
inset via @racket[nested] with the style @racket['code-inset]. The
source locations of the @racket[datum]s determine the generated
layout. For example,

@racketblock[
(racketblock
 (define (loop x)
   (loop (not x))))
]

produces the output

@racketblock[
(define (loop x)
  (loop (not x)))
]

with the @racket[(loop (not x))] indented under @racket[define],
because that's the way it is idented the use of @racket[racketblock].
Source-location span information is used to preserve @racket[#true]
versus @racket[#t] and @racket[#false] versus @racket[#f]; span
information is also used heuristically to add @racketvalfont{#i}
to the start of an inexact number if its printed form would otherwise
be two characters shorter than the source;
syntax-object properties are used to preserve square brackets and
curly braces versus parentheses; otherwise, using syntax objects tends
to normalize the form of S-expression elements, such as rendering
@code{2/4} as @racket[2/4]. When source-location information is not
available, such as when it is lost by bytecode-compiled macros,
spacing is inserted in the same style (within a single line) as the
@racket[racket] form.

@margin-note{See also @racket[quote-syntax/keep-srcloc] for use in a
macro to preserve source-location information in a template.}

In the above example, @racket[define] is typeset as a keyword (in black)
and as a hyperlink to @racket[define]'s definition in the reference
manual, because this document was built using a @racket[for-label] binding of
@racket[define] (in the source) that matches a definition in the
reference manual. Similarly, @racket[not] is a hyperlink to its
definition in the reference manual.

Like other forms defined via @racket[define-code],
@racket[racketblock] expands identifiers that are bound as
@tech{element transformers}.

An @racket[#:escape] clause specifies an identifier to escape back to
an expression that produces an @racket[element]. By default,
the escape identifier is @racket[unsyntax]. For example,

@racketblock[
#:escape nonesuch
(racketblock
  (+ 1 (unsyntax (elem (racket x) (subscript "2")))))
]

produces

@racketblock[
(+ 1 (unsyntax (elem (racket x) (subscript "2"))))
]

The @racket[escape-id] that defaults to @racket[unsyntax] is recognized via
@racket[free-identifier=?], so a binding can hide the escape behavior:

@RACKETBLOCK[
(racketblock
  (let ([(UNSYNTAX (racket unsyntax)) #f])
    (racketblock
      (syntax (+ 1 (unsyntax x))))))
]

The @racket[RACKETBLOCK] form's default escape is @racket[UNSYNTAX]
instead of @racket[unsyntax].

A few other escapes are recognized symbolically:

@itemize[

 @item{@racket[(#,(indexed-racket code:line) _datum ...)] typesets as the
       sequence of @racket[_datum]s (i.e., without the
       @racket[code:line] wrapper).}

 @item{@racket[(#,(indexed-racket code:comment) _content)] typesets like
       @racket[_content], but colored as a comment and prefixed with a
       semi-colon. A typical @racket[_content] escapes from
       Racket-typesetting mode using @racket[unsyntax] and
       produces a string, an element using @racket[elem],
       or a paragraph using @racket[t]:

       @verbatim[#:indent 2]|{
         (code:comment @#,elem{this is a comment})
       }|

       (Note that @litchar|{@#,foo{...}}| reads as
       @RACKET[(unsyntax (foo "..."))].)
       }

 @item{@racket[(#,(indexed-racket code:contract) _datum ...)] typesets like
       the sequence of @racket[_datum]s (including its coloring), but prefixed with a
       semi-colon.}

 @item{@as-index[@racketidfont{code:blank}] typesets as a blank space.}

 @item{@racket[(#,(indexed-racket code:hilite) _datum)] typesets like
       @racket[_datum], but with a background highlight.}

 @item{@racket[(#,(indexed-racket code:quote) _datum)] typesets like
       @racket[(@#,racketidfont{quote} _datum)], but without rendering the
       @racketidfont{quote} as @litchar{'}.}

 @item{@racketidfont{_}@racket[_id] typesets as @racket[id], but
       colored as a variable (like @racket[racketvarfont]); this
       escape applies only if @racketidfont{_}@racket[_id] has no
       for-label binding and is not specifically colored as a subform
       non-terminal via @racket[defform], a variable via
       @racket[defproc], etc.}

@subsection{Preserving Comments}

@defmodulereader[scribble/comment-reader]

As a reader module, @racketmodname[scribble/comment-reader] reads a
single S-expression that contains @litchar{;}-based comment lines, and
it wraps the comments with @racket[code:comment] for use with forms
like @racket[racketblock]. More precisely,
@racketmodname[scribble/comment-reader] extends the current reader to
adjust the parsing of @litchar{;}.

For example, within a Scribble document that imports
@racketmodname[scribble/manual],

@verbatim[#:indent 2]|{
  @#reader scribble/comment-reader
   (racketblock
    ;; This is not a pipe
    (make-pipe)
   )
}|

generates

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
 (racketblock
  ;; This is not a pipe
  (make-pipe)
 )

The initial @litchar["@"] is needed above to shift into S-expression
mode, so that @racketmetafont{#reader} is recognized as a reader
declaration instead of literal text. Also, the example uses
@racket[(racketblock ....)]  instead of
@racketmetafont["@"]@racket[racketblock]@racketmetafont["["]@racket[....]@racketmetafont["]"]
because the @"@"-reader would drop comments within the
@racket[racketblock] before giving
@racketmodname[scribble/comment-reader] a chance to convert them.

The implementation of @racketmodname[scribble/comment-reader] uses @racket[unsyntax] to
typeset comments. When using @racketmodname[scribble/comment-reader]
with, for instance, @racket[RACKETBLOCK], @racket[unsyntax] does not escape,
since @racket[RACKETBLOCK] uses @racket[UNSYNTAX] as its escape form. You can
declare an escape identifier for
@racketmodname[scribble/comment-reader] with @racket[#:escape-id]. For example,

@verbatim[#:indent 2]|{
  @#reader scribble/comment-reader #:escape-id UNSYNTAX
   (RACKETBLOCK
     (define-syntax (m stx)
       (syntax-case stx ()
         [(_ x)
          ;; Well this was silly
          #`(#,x)]))
   )
}|

generates

  @#reader scribble/comment-reader #:escape-id UNSYNTAX
   (RACKETBLOCK
     (define-syntax (m stx)
       (syntax-case stx ()
         [(_ x)

                       (code:line #:packages (pkg-expr ...))])]{

Produces a sequence of flow elements (in a @racket[splice])
to start the documentation for a module---or for multiple modules, if
the @racket[#:multi] form is used.

Each documented module specified as either a @racket[module-path] (in
the sense of @racket[require]), in which case the module path is
typeset using @racket[racketmodname], or by a
@racket[content-expr]. The latter case is triggered by the presence of
a @racket[#:module-paths] clause, which provides a plain
@racket[module-path] for each @racket[module-spec], and the plain
@racket[module-path] is used for cross-referencing.

If a @racket[#:require-form] clause is provided and if @racket[#:lang]
and @racket[#:reader] are not provided, the given expression produces
content to use instead of @racket[require] for the declaration of the
module. The @racket[#:require-form] clause is useful to suggest a
different way of accessing the module instead of through
@racket[require].

Besides generating text, unless @racket[#:no-declare] appears as an
option, this form expands to a use of @racket[declare-exporting] with
@racket[module-path]s; the @racket[#:use-sources] clause, if provided,
is propagated to @racket[declare-exporting]. Consequently,
@racket[defmodule] should be used at most once in a section without
@racket[#:no-declare], though it can be shadowed with
@racket[defmodule]s in sub-sections.  Use @racket[#:no-declare] form
when you want to provide a more specific list of modules (e.g., to
name both a specific module and one that combines several modules) via
your own @racket[declare-exporting] declaration

When @racket[#:link-target?] is omitted or specified with an expression that
produces a true value, then the @racket[module-path]s are also
declared as link targets though a @racket[part-tag-decl] (which means
that the @racket[defmodule] form must appear before any
sub-parts). These link targets are referenced via
@racket[racketmodname], which thus points to the enclosing section,
rather than the individual @racket[module-path]s.

Specifying @racket[#:indirect] normally makes sense only when
@racket[#:link-target?] is specified with a @racket[#f] value. Specifying
@racket[#:indirect] makes the module path that is displayed (and that
normally refers to some other declaration of the module) use
@racket[racketmodname] with @racket[#:indirect].

If @racket[#:lang] is provided as an option, then the module name is
shown after @hash-lang[] (instead of in a @racket[require] form) to
indicate that the @racket[module-path]s are suitable for use by either
@racket[require] or @hash-lang[].  If the module path for
@racket[require] is syntactically different from the @hash-lang[]
form, use @racket[#:module-paths] to provide the @racket[require]
variant (and make each @racket[module-spec] a @racket[content-expr]).

If @racket[#:reader] is provided, then the module name is shown after
@racketmetafont{#reader} to indicate that the module path is intended
for use as a reader module.

By default, the package (if any) that supplies the documented module
is determined automatically, but a set of providing packages can be
specified explicitly with @racket[#:packages]. Each @racket[pkg-expr]
result is passed on to a function like @racket[tt] for
typesetting. Provide an empty sequence after @racket[#:packages] to
suppress any package name in the output. Each @racket[pkg-expr]
expression is duplicated for a  @racket[declare-exporting] form,
unless @racket[#:no-declare] is specified.

Each @racket[option] form can appear at most once, and @racket[#:lang]
and @racket[#:reader] are mutually exclusive.

The @tech{decode}d @racket[pre-flow]s introduce the module, but need
not include all of the module content.}

Associates the @racket[module-path]s to all bindings defined within the
enclosing section, except as overridden by other
@racket[declare-exporting] declarations in nested sub-sections.  The
list of @racket[module-path]s before @racket[#:use-sources] is shown, for
example, when the user hovers the mouse over one of the bindings
defined within the section. A @racket[unquote]-escaped
@racket[,module-path-expr] can be used in place of a
@racket[module-path] to compute the module path dynamically.

More significantly, the first @racket[module-path] before
@racket[#:use-sources] plus the @racket[module-path]s after
@racket[#:use-sources] determine the binding that is documented by
each @racket[defform], @racket[defproc], or similar form within the
section that contains the @racket[declare-exporting] declaration:

@itemize[

 @item{If no @racket[#:use-sources] clause is supplied, then the
       documentation applies to the given name as exported by the first
       @racket[module-path].}

 @item{If @racket[#:use-sources] @racket[module-path]s are supplied, then
       they are tried in order before the first @racket[module-path]. The
       @racket[module-path] that provides an export with the same
       symbolic name and @racket[free-label-identifier=?] to the given
       name is used as the documented binding. This binding is assumed
       to be the same as the identifier as exported by the first
       @racket[module-path] in the @racket[declare-exporting]
       declaration.}

]

Use @racket[#:use-sources] sparingly, but it is needed when

@itemlist[

 @item{bindings are documented as originating from a module
       @racket[_M], but the bindings are actually re-exported from
       some module @racket[_P]; and}

 @item{other documented modules also re-export the bindings from
       @racket[_P], but they are documented as re-exporting from
       @racket[_M].}

]

For example, the @racket[parameterize] binding of
@racketmodname[mzscheme] is documented as re-exported from
@racketmodname[racket/base], but @racket[parameterize] happens to be
implemented in a private module and re-exported by both
@racketmodname[racket/base] and @racketmodname[mzscheme].  Importing
@racket[parameterize] from @racketmodname[mzscheme] does not go
through @racketmodname[racket/base], so a search for documentation on
@racket[parameterize] in @racketmodname[mzscheme] would not
automatically connect to the documentation of
@racketmodname[racket/base]. To make the connection, the documentation
of @racketmodname[racket/base] declares the private module to be a
source through @racket[#:use-sources], so that any re-export of
@racket[parameterize] from the private module connects to the
documentation for @racketmodname[racket/base] (unless a re-export has
its own documentation, which would override the automatic connection
when searching for documentation).

The initial @racket[module-path]s sequence can be empty if
@racket[module-path]s are given with @racket[#:use-sources]. In that
case, the rendered documentation never reports an exporting module for
identifiers that are documented within the section, but the
@racket[module-path]s in @racket[#:use-sources] provide a binding context
for connecting (via hyperlinks) definitions and uses of identifiers.

Supply @racket[#:packages] to specify the package that provides the
declared modules, which is otherwise inferred automatically from the
first @racket[module-path]. The package names are used, for example,
by @racket[history].

The @racket[declare-exporting] form should be used no more than once
per section, since the declaration applies to the entire section,
although overriding @racket[declare-exporting] forms can appear in
sub-sections.

 }]

When @racket[id] is indexed and registered, 
a @racket[defmodule] or @racket[declare-exporting] form (or one of the
variants) in an enclosing section determines the @racket[id] binding
that is being defined. The @racket[id] should also have a for-label
binding (as introduced by @racket[(require (for-label ....))]) that
matches the definition binding; otherwise, the defined @racket[id]
will not typeset correctly within the definition.

Each @racket[arg-spec] must have one of the following forms:

@specsubform[(arg-id contract-expr-datum)]{
       An argument whose contract is specified by
       @racket[contract-expr-datum] which is typeset via
       @racket[racketblock0].}

@specsubform[(arg-id contract-expr-datum default-expr)]{
       Like the previous case, but with a default value. All arguments
       with a default value must be grouped together, but they can be
       in the middle of required arguments.}

@specsubform[(keyword arg-id contract-expr-datum)]{
       Like the first case, but for a keyword-based argument.}

@specsubform[(keyword arg-id contract-expr-datum default-expr)]{
       Like the previous case, but with a default
       value.}

@specsubform[@#,lit-ellipses]{Any number of the preceding argument.  This
       form is normally used at the end, but keyword-based arguments
       can sensibly appear afterward. See also the documentation for
       @racket[append] for a use of @lit-ellipses before the last
       argument.}

@specsubform[@#,lit-ellipses+]{One or more of the preceding argument
       (normally at the end, like @lit-ellipses).}

The @racket[result-contract-expr-datum] is typeset via
@racket[racketblock0], and it represents a contract on the procedure's
result.

The @tech{decode}d @racket[pre-flow] documents the procedure. In this
description, references to @svar[arg-id]s using @racket[racket],
@racket[racketblock], @|etc| are typeset as procedure arguments.

The typesetting of all information before the @racket[pre-flow]s
ignores the source layout, except that the local formatting is
preserved for contracts and default-values expressions. The information
is formatted to fit (if possible) in the number of characters specified
by the @racket[current-display-width] parameter.

An optional @racket[#:kind] specification chooses the decorative
label, which defaults to @racket["procedure"]. A @racket[#f]
result for @racket[kind-content-expr] uses the default, otherwise
@racket[kind-content-expr] should produce content in the sense of @racket[content?]. An alternate
label should be all lowercase.

If @racket[#:id [src-id dest-id-expr]] is supplied, then
@racket[src-id] is the identifier as it appears in the
@racket[prototype] (to be replaced by a defining instance), and
@racket[dest-id-expr] produces the identifier to be documented in
place of @racket[src-id]. This split between @racket[src-id] and
@racket[dest-id-expr] roles is useful for functional abstraction of
@racket[defproc].

If @racket[#:value value-expr-datum] is given, @racket[value-expr-datum]
is typeset using @racket[racketblock0] and included in the documentation.
As a service to readers, please use @racket[#:value] to document only
simple, short functions.

Like @racket[defproc], but for multiple cases with the same
@racket[id]. Multiple distinct @racket[id]s can also be defined by a
single @racket[defproc*], for the case that it's best to document a
related group of procedures at once (but multiple @racket[defproc]s
grouped by @racket[deftogether] also works for that case).

When an @racket[id] has multiple calling cases, either they must be
defined with a single @racket[defproc*], so that a single definition
point exists for the @racket[id], or else all but one definition
should use @racket[#:link-target? #f].

Produces a sequence of flow elements (encapsulated in a

result of @racket[id-expr]) whose syntax is described by
@racket[form-datum]. If no @racket[#:id] is used to specify
@racket[id], then @racket[form-datum] must have the form @racket[(id
. _datum)].

If @racket[#:kind kind-content-expr] is supplied, it is used in the
same way as for @racket[defproc], but the default kind is
@racket["syntax"].

If @racket[#:id [id id-expr]] is supplied, then @racket[id] is the
identifier as it appears in the @racket[form-datum] (to be replaced by
a defining instance), and @racket[id-expr] produces the identifier to
be documented. This split between @racket[id] and @racket[id-expr]
roles is useful for functional abstraction of @racket[defform].

Unless @racket[link-target?-expr] is specified
and produces @racket[#f], 
the @racket[id] (or result of @racket[id-expr]) is indexed, and it is
also registered so that @racket[racket]-typeset uses of the identifier

documentation. The @racket[defmodule] or @racket[declare-exporting]
requirements, as well as the binding requirements for @racket[id] (or
result of @racket[id-expr]), are the same as for @racket[defproc].

The @tech{decode}d @racket[pre-flow] documents the form. In this
description, a reference to any identifier in @racket[form-datum] via
@racket[racket], @racket[racketblock], @|etc| is typeset as a sub-form
non-terminal. If @racket[#:literals] clause is provided, however,
instances of the @racket[literal-id]s are typeset normally (i.e., as
determined by the enclosing context).

If a @racket[#:grammar] clause is provided, it includes an auxiliary
grammar of non-terminals shown with the @racket[id] form. Each
@racket[nonterm-id] is specified as being any of the corresponding
@racket[clause-datum]s.

If a @racket[#:contracts] clause is provided, each
@racket[subform-datum] (typically an identifier that serves as a
meta-variable in @racket[form-datum] or @racket[clause-datum]) is
shown as producing a value that must satisfy the contract described by
@racket[contract-expr-datum].  Use @racket[#:contracts] only to
specify constraints on a @emph{value} produced by an expression; for
constraints on the @emph{syntax} of a @racket[subform-datum], use
grammar notation instead, possibly through an auxiliary grammar
specified with @racket[#:grammar].

The typesetting of @racket[form-datum], @racket[clause-datum],
@racket[subform-datum], and @racket[contract-expr-datum] preserves the
source layout, like @racket[racketblock].

used in the documentation for @racket[defproc] in the itemization of
possible shapes for @svar[arg-spec].

provides the identifier must be declared via @racket[defmodule] or
@racket[declare-exporting] for an enclosing section.

If @racket[form?] is a true value, then the identifier is documented
as a syntactic form, so that uses of the identifier (normally
including @racket[id] itself) are typeset as a syntactic form.

If @racket[index?] is a true value, then the identifier is registered
in the index.

                  [#:style? style? any/c #t]) element?]{

Produces an element for the @tech{decode}d @racket[pre-content], and
also defines a term that can be referenced elsewhere using
@racket[tech].

When @racket[key] is @racket[#f], the @racket[content->string] result
of the @tech{decode}d @racket[pre-content] is used as a key for
references. If @racket[normalize?] is true, then the key string is
normalized as follows:

@itemize[

 @item{The string is case-folded.}

 @item{A trailing ``ies'' is replaced by ``y''.}

 @item{A trailing ``s'' is removed.}

 @item{Consecutive hyphens and whitespaces are all replaced by a
       single space.}

]

These normalization steps help support natural-language references
that differ slightly from a defined form. For example, a definition of
``bananas'' can be referenced with a use of ``banana''.

If @racket[style?] is true, then @racket[defterm] is used on
@racket[pre-content].}

               [#:tag-prefixes prefixes (or/c (listof string?) #f) #f])
         element?]{

Produces an element for the @tech{decode}d @racket[pre-content], and
hyperlinks it to the definition of the key as established by
@racket[deftech]. If @racket[key] is false, the decoded content is
converted to a string (using @racket[content->string]) to use as a
key; in either case, if @racket[normalize?] is true, the key is normalized in the same way as for
@racket[deftech]. The @racket[#:doc] and @racket[#:tag-prefixes]
arguments support cross-document and section-specific references, like
in @racket[secref].
For example:
@racketblock[@tech[#:doc '(lib "scribblings/reference/reference.scrbl")]{blame object}]

creates a link to @tech[#:doc '(lib "scribblings/reference/reference.scrbl")]{blame object} in
@other-doc['(lib "scribblings/reference/reference.scrbl")].

With the default style files, the hyperlink created by @racket[tech]
is somewhat quieter than most hyperlinks: the underline in HTML output
is gray, instead of blue, and the term and underline turn blue only
when the mouse is moved over the term.

In some cases, combining both natural-language uses of a term and
proper linking can require some creativity, even with the
normalization performed on the term. For example, if ``bind'' is
defined, but a sentence uses the term ``binding,'' the latter can be
linked to the former using @racketfont["@tech{bind}ing"].}

@defproc[(techlink [pre-content pre-content?] ...
                   [#:key key (or/c string? #f) #f]

output, a hyperlink underline appears even when the mouse is not over
the link.}
