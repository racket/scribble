Example of a defmodule:

```

Example of a defproc:

```racket
(make-string k [char]) -> string?
  k : exact-nonnegative-integer?
  char : char? = #\nul
```

Returns a new mutable string of length `k` where each position in the
string is initialized with the character `char`

Blah blah `(or/c string? bytes?)`.
