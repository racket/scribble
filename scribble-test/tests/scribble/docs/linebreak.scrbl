So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse @(linebreak)
And found such fair assistance in my verse @linebreak[]
As every alien pen hath got my use @(linebreak)
And under thee their poesy disperse.

Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing @linebreak[]
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly, @linebreak[]
Have added feathers to the learnèd's wing @linebreak[] And given grace a double majesty.

Yet be most proud of that which I compile, @linebreak[] Whose influence is thine
and born of thee. @linebreak[] In others' works thou dost
but mend the style, @linebreak[]
And arts with thy sweet graces gracèd be;

But thou art all my art, and dost advance @linebreak[]
As high learning my rude ignorance.
