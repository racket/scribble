;; Resources are renderable & referrable objects, (most are html pages).

;; (resource path renderer) creates and returns a new "resource" value.  The
;; arguments are:
;; - `path': the path of the output file, relative to the working directory,
;;   indicating where the resource file should be put at, also corresponding to
;;   the URL it will be found at.  It must be a `/'-separated relative string,
;;   no `..', `.', or `//', and it can end in `/' (which will turn to
;;   "index.html").
;; - `renderer': a unary function that renders the resource, receiving the path
;;   for the file to be created as an argument.  This path will be different
;;   than the `path' argument because this function is invoked in the target
;;   directory.
;; The resulting resource value is a function that returns the URL for the
;; resource.  The function takes in an optional boolean which defaults to #f,
;; and when #t is given, the result will be an absolute full URL.  Note that
;; the function can be used as a value for output, which will use it as a thunk
;; (that renders as the relative URL for the resource).  The default relative
;; resulting URL is, of course, a value that depends on the currently rendered
;; resource that uses this value.  Creating a resource registers the `renderer'
;; to be executed when rendering is initiated by `render-all'.  Note that more
;; resources can be created while rendering; they will also be rendered in turn
;; until no more new resources are created.
